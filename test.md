> Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.
What can I do?

> Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:
> * Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
> * Crawl a SPA and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR").
> * Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.
> * Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.
> * Capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues.
